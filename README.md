# Project-Super-Cashier

Background Project
This program is made as a self service cashier system. Customers can input the items purchased, the quantity, the price based on the store list, as well as several other features. This program is created to make it easier for customers to record what items were purchased without having to come directly to the store, and also make it easier for store owners / managers to prepare what items the customer purchased in more details.
