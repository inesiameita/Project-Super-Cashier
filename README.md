# Project-Super-Cashier


**Background Project**

This program is made as a self service cashier system. Customers can input the items purchased, the quantity, the price based on the store list, as well as several other features. This program is created to make it easier for customers to record what items were purchased without having to come directly to the store, and also make it easier for store owners / managers to prepare what items the customer purchased in more details.   




**Objective / Requirements**


The customers will make an order by inputting the items purchased themself (self service system), then the total payment will appear at the end of the transaction.

1. Create a transaction 
2. Display a list of items that can be ordered 
3. Input how many items purchased
4. Add 'item_name' , 'item_qty' , 'item_price' 
5. Display order list as a table
6. Update 'item_name' as 'new_name', if there is a change in the name of the item purchased
7. Update 'item_qty' , if there is a change in the quantity of the item purchased
8. Update 'item_price' , if there is a change in the price of the item purchased
9. Delete 'item_name' , if the item is canceled to be purchased
10. Reset transaction to delete all the items purchased
11. Check order list, wheter it is appropriate or not
12. Calculate the discount from total_transaction:
    * If total_transaction > 200,000 will get discount 5%
    * If total_transaction > 300,000 will get discount 8%
    * If total_transaction > 500,000 will get discount 10%
